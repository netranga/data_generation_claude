## Key Features
- Extraction of structured Q&A pairs from PDF documents without OCR, leveraging foundational model vision capabilities.
- Generates two distinct, valid answers for each question, enabling contrastive learning techniques.
- Uses Claude Opus to evaluate responses and identify the better answer based on level of detail.

## Value Proposition
1. Reduces the manual effort required by SMEs for creating curated golden evaluation datasetsâ€”a cumbersome process often plagued by subjective quality disagreements.
2. Lowers costs significantly through efficient techniques like caching and batching.
3. Enhances contextual awareness and generates higher-quality Q&A pairs by incorporating charts, images, and diagrams.
